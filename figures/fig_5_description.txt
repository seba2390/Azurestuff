N = 4,5,...,12, k = N//2, max_iterations = 1000, alpha=0.5, Averaged over 100 runs, Used 3 Layers every time.

Using 1D chain w. following initialization strategies:

               [0,1,0,1],

               [0,1,0,1,0],

               [0,1,0,1,0,1],

               [0,1,0,1,0,1,0],

               [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1],

               [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0],

               [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1],

               [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0],

               [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]

Used Nearest-Neighbor interactions only.
Initial parameters sampled random uniformly in [-2*pi;2*pi]
Used COBYLA to optimize.

The normalization of the cost is done wrt. the max cost
of a 'N' choose 'K' state (the subspace).

Nr. of parameters here is generally (N-1) * # Layers = (N-1)*3
